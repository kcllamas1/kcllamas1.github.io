                         <p> 
                            <strong>Volleyball</strong> : Since I am so busy, I occasionally get the chance to play a little game of volleyball with my friends, which is something I always look forward to. I have been playing volleyball since I was in elementary
                            school, so it has been a part of my life for a long time. Although I am definitely not at any professional level, I understand how challenging, fast paced, and exciting the sport can be. Volleyball requires a lot of teamwork, communication, 
                            and quick reactions, which makes every game feel different and engaging.<br>
                            <br>
                            I have also attended a few volleyball games at CU Boulder, and they are always really fun to watch. The energy of the crowd and the skill of the players make the experience exciting, even for someone who is just watching from the stands.
                            I also often watch volleyball on the TV with my sister, since she is a much bigger fan of the sport than I am. Watching games together is a nice way for us to spend time together and enjoy something we both appreciate. Overall, volleyball 
                            is a sport that I may not play as often anymore, but it is still something I enjoy and respect.

                    <h3> Social </h3>
                        <P> <strong>Latinx Involvement</strong>> : I am involved in several student organizations that play an important role in my college experience, especially those that focus on community, culture, and professional growth. I am most involved in my 
                            Latina-based sorority, Pi Lambda Chi, where I currently serve as both the Recruitment Chair and the Herstorian. Through these leadership roles, I help plan recruitment events, support new members, and document the history and achievements
                            of our chapter. Being part of this sorority has allowed me to build strong connections, develop leadership skills, and stay closely connected to my culture. In addition to my sorority involvement, I am a member of SHPE, which stands for
                            the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. This organization is more career-focused and provides opportunities to network with professionals, attend workshops, and meet other students who share similar academic and career goals. SHPE has helped me learn more about potential career paths and how to prepare for the professional world. I also attend events hosted by the Latinx Student Alliance, which creates welcoming spaces for Latinx students to connect through social, cultural, and educational events. Overall, these organizations have helped me feel supported, involved, and motivated throughout my college journey.</P>
